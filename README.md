The fictitious university has decided to move all services to the web. All the processes will be handled with those services. Firstly, the management team (system administrator) can control over the entire platform by controlling faculties, institutes, departments.  
 
The student affair department is in charge of managing students. Each student detail includes ID, name, date of birth, registration date, term address, etc.. Also, they can add/remove the enrolled course for a particular student.
 
The HR department is responsible for staff management process.  When a new staff has been appointed a position, they will add to them to the faculty member list.   Also, HR can manage staff contract with the university. They can remove, update the contract accordingly.
 
The faculty has multiple departments, and each department can add/remove a course to the curriculum.  The faculty departments are in charge of undergraduate students.
